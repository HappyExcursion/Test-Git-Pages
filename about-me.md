# About Me

### Sorry, I don't have any personal information to share.

### Spot a white lie:

1. I hate my life
2. I have an electric skateboard
3. I grew up with John Lennon, space shuttle pictures from science magazines, and communist ideology.


### What I Have Lived For -- Bertrand Russell

Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds, have blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great ocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.
